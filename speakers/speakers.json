Realizing that the only way she could bring real time experience to her classroom was if she became an entrepreneur herself, she founded CARMa (Creating Access to Resources & Markets; www.carmaconnect.in) with a lofty ambition: to offer professional mentoring to entrepreneurs as a risk mitigating strategy. CARMa mentors start-ups, mature enterprises and family businesses. As on date, CARMa has mentored over 2000 entrepreneurs. CARMa has also been involved in mentoring women to scale from livelihood enterprises to opportunity-based and profitable organizations in Afghanistan, South and East Africa and India. Till date over 10,000 women have been mentored to build scalable and profitable enterprises. <br>A prolific writer for mainstream newspapers, portals and blogs, her first book Entrepedia: A Step by Step Guide to Becoming an Entrepreneur in India, has been a best-seller since its launch in 2011. Its second edition, updated and contemporized, came out in 2015 and has become the Bible of the start-up community. Her second book, Start up, Stand up, was published in 2016. While Entrepedia was all about how to take an idea from your head to the marketplace, Start up, Stand up is about how to grow your business from your first paying customer to an evangelical user community. <br>A TED speaker and regular jury member of television shows on business channels and entrepreneurship events across the world, she was named Business Woman of the Year by Business Goa in 2014. <br>Passionate about cooking and entertaining people, her versatility extends to the Carnatic form of music in which she is a trained singer.
