Enter 'the Quantum realm': where the laws of nature don't seem to work and apparently runs with a set of principles known to the tech world by the name quantum mechanics.Although Quantum computers have been in existence for quite a long time now, the seemingly complex realm of quantum mechanics had restrained people from entering the field. Yet, the amazing technology of quantum computers shouldn't be hard to learn and rightfully so. At the 69th edition of FAYA:80 Trivandrum, experience the entanglements and superpositions of the exciting field of Quantum Computers. Meet Simsar, a Quantum computing researcher, explain in simple terms what the technology is all about, modern developments in the field, and why you should care about quantum computing. The session will be beneficial for all technology enthusiasts, senior-level managers, developers, entrepreneurs, and hobbyists to explore the expanding field of quantum computers.<strong>Topics Covered</strong>Evolution of Computing and Complexity theory.<br>Basic building blocks of a Quantum Computer.<br>Quantum Computers for Optimization, Machine Learning, Cryptography and more.<br>Design and Implementation of Quantum Algorithms."

The popularity gained by Docker in the recent times is solely due to its power to assemble and manage the applications and their dependencies on a single platform. This flexibility and portability provided by Docker has made it the most sought after technology pivots.<br>Even though there is a vast adoption of docker globally, the rate of its adoption in our community has taken a back seat. This is due to the lack of expertise and fear of failure to overcome the challenges during its initial implementation.<br>The 47th edition of FAYA:80 provides the right platform for the technology enthusiasts to know Docker as an end-to-end entity right from its basic concepts to its implementation on the cloud. The session will be equally beneficial for System Administrators, Developers, Testers and even the top level Technical and Non- Technical Managers to gain better insights on Docker. The session will provide a chance for the newbies to understand Docker from the scratch and for the experts to get their roadblocks cleared, thereby providing more confidence for both the categories to initiate or fasten its implementation.<strong>Topics Covered:</strong>Docker Concepts<br>VM vs Containers<br>Best Practices<br>Use Cases<br>Docker in the Cloud<br>Live Demo<strong>Sessions:</strong>Techbites (Speaker: Mohammed Thaha, FAYA)<br>Launch it with Docker (Speaker: Amal Dev, UST Global)"
